Beamformer of microphone array code is generated by my partner Hongyu.\r\n3. For noise deduction, several methods are tested while Parametric Spectral Subtraction method preserves the best quality.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------\r\n*Liu Cheng, University of Ottawa*\r\n\r\n**copyright (c) 2014 - 2015.**\r\n","google":"UA-56786218-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
